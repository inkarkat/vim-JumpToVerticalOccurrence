DESCRIPTION				*JumpToVerticalOccurrence-description*

The |f| / |F| commands allow you to quickly go to next / previous occurrences
of a character in the same line (with plugins also across lines), but are
limited to horizontal movement. But vertical movement, restricted to the same
screen column the cursor is in, across lines would often be helpful, too.

This plugin provides a |]V|{char} mapping that works just like |f|, but
vertically. The |]v| mapping is similar, but uses the character under the
cursor instead of querying for it (which is a more common use case when moving
vertically).
The ]| mapping is helpful for jumping out of indented blocks, or to filled-out
columns, as it moves to the next non-whitespace in the current column.
In long sorted lists, one often wants to go to the first / last instance of
the current character (e.g. to move from "[A]ddress" to "Aardvark" or the last
"Azure" before the entries with "B" begin). The |]!| mapping does that.

SOURCE									     *

The ]| mapping was inspired by
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20882722/move-to-the-next-row-which-has-non-white-space-character-in-the-same-column-in-v

SEE ALSO								     *

- The |JumpToLastOccurrence.vim| plugin (vimscript #3386) still moves
  horizontally in the same line, but counts the characters in reverse,
  starting from the last one.
- The |JumpToVerticalBlock.vim| plugin (vimscript #0000) has motions that
  operate like |W| and |E|, but vertically.
- Check out the |CountJump.vim| plugin page (vimscript #3130) for a full list
  of motions and text objects powered by it.

RELATED WORKS								     *

- columnmove (vimscript #4880) defines f/t/;/, commands as well as w/e/b/ge
  commands that work vertically, either skipping or opening closed folds.
- columnMove (vimscript #5402) moves to the end / start of vertical blocks of
  non-whitespace.

USAGE					      *JumpToVerticalOccurrence-usage*

					 *]v* *[v* *v_]v* *v_[v* *o_]v* *o_[v*
]v		    To [count]'th occurrence of the character under the cursor
		    in the same screen column of following lines.
[v		    To [count]'th occurrence of the character under the cursor
		    in the same screen column of previous lines.

					 *]V* *[V* *v_]V* *v_[V* *o_]V* *o_[V*
]V{char}	    To [count]'th occurrence of {char} in the same screen
		    column of following lines. Like |f|, but vertically.
[V{char}	    To [count]'th occurrence of {char} in the same screen
		    column of previous lines. Like |F|, but vertically.
		    You can quickly repeat the same motion via the |]v| / |[v|
		    mappings (like |;| / |,| for |f|).

			     *]bar* *[bar* *v_]bar* *v_[bar* *o_]bar* *o_[bar*
]|		    To [count]'th next line that has non-whitespace in the
		    same column as the current one.
[|		    To [count]'th previous line that has non-whitespace in the
		    same column as the current one.

					 *]!* *[!* *v_]!* *v_[!* *o_]!* *o_[!*
]!		    To the last continuous occurrence of the character under
		    the cursor in the same screen column. With any [count],
		    skips over whitespace and shorter lines.
[!		    To the first continuous occurrence of the character under
		    the cursor in the same screen column. With any [count],
		    skips over whitespace and shorter lines.
		    Mnemonic: The ! looks like a column, with the dot marking
		    the jump target.

INSTALLATION			       *JumpToVerticalOccurrence-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim JumpToVerticalOccurrence*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES			       *JumpToVerticalOccurrence-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the CountJump plugin (vimscript #3130), version 1.60 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.016 or
  higher.
- repeat.vim (vimscript #2136) plugin (optional)

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION			      *JumpToVerticalOccurrence-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
					      *JumpToVerticalOccurrence-remap*
To change the default motion mappings, use: >
    let g:JumpToVerticalOccurrence_CharUnderCursorMapping = 'v'
    let g:JumpToVerticalOccurrence_QueriedMapping = 'V'
    let g:JumpToVerticalOccurrence_NonWhitespaceMapping = '<Bar>'
    let g:JumpToVerticalOccurrence_LastSameCharMapping = '!'
To also change the [ / ] prefix to something else, follow the instructions for
|CountJump-remap-motions|.
